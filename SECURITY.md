Hi team ðŸ‘‹

I noticed that this project hasn't set up a SECURITY.md file yet. Adding one would help researchers and users understand how to report potential security vulnerabilities responsibly.

GitHub even provides a standard for this file(https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/creating-a-securitymd-file), which can include:

Contact details for responsible disclosure
Supported versions
Guidelines on what to include in a report
